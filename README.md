# AIM:
To develop the Hospital Management System using Star UML.

# Problem Statement:
1.Hospital Management System is needed to streamline and automate various hospital operations that are currently handled manually or with fragmented software, leading to inefficiencies and errors.

2.Managing patient records, appointments, billing, and medical histories manually causes delays, data loss, and poor coordination among departments.

3.Patients face difficulties in booking appointments, accessing their medical reports, and receiving timely notifications for tests or follow-ups.

4.Hospital staff and doctors require a centralized platform to manage patient information, schedule consultations, prescribe medications, and track treatments efficiently.

5.The system should integrate pharmacy management, billing, staff management, and inventory control to improve overall hospital workflow and resource utilization.

6.It must ensure secure, role-based access for doctors, nurses, administrative staff, and patients, while maintaining data confidentiality and complying with healthcare regulations.
